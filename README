Welcome to my Python Crash Course. 
You might notice that I already have 2 crash courses. 
This one combines the 2 and divides each topic into its own file. 
Here are the topics we will be covering: 
-Hello World and Printing 
-Strings
-Lists
-If Statements
-Loops 
-Dictionaries 
-Taking User Inputs 
-Writing to Text Files 
-Subroutines/MultipleFunctions 
-Importing Libraries
-Classes 

Each file will have directions, code, and a small excerise for the user 
Then there will be 2 larger programs with solutions so the user can combine everything they learned. 
I hope you enjoy my more interactive and a little more classroom friendly set up.
